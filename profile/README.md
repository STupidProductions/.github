**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

# Welcome to STupidProductions

STupidProductions is the place where STupidLord's repos go. Thia place will mainly be for my public projects and projects with actual dev teams instead of just one person.

P.S. to STupidLord: Remember to update this later when you have ideas :)
